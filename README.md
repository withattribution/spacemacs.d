#Spacemacs configuration largely based off of https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs.d

Notable features that were pruned from the referenced configuration are but might be interesting for future inclusion:
* keycast
* org-journal keybindings and variable configs
* diff-hl and magit-repository-directories
* org-mode todo keywords
* clojure # toggle
* web mode configs
* eshell visual updates

Otherwise the above mentioned were either not being used directly or cluttered my understanding of the spacemacs configuration env or produced distracting errors, less is more right now ;)
